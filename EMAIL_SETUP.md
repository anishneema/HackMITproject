# Real Email Sending Setup

## Current Status
âœ… **Real Email Sending Implemented!** The system now sends actual emails instead of just simulating them.

## Quick Setup (Gmail)

### 1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication
- Go to your Google Account settings
- Enable 2-Factor Authentication if not already enabled

### 2. Generate App Password
- Go to Google Account â†’ Security â†’ App passwords
- Generate a new app password for "Mail"
- Copy the 16-character password (e.g., `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

### 3. Update Environment Variables
Edit your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# SMTP Email Configuration (for real email sending)
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-16-character-app-password
SMTP_FROM_NAME=Red Cross Events Team
SMTP_FROM_EMAIL=hackmit@agentmail.to
```

**Important:** 
- Use your actual Gmail address for `SMTP_USER`
- Use the 16-character app password (not your regular password) for `SMTP_PASS`
- The `SMTP_FROM_EMAIL` can be `hackmit@agentmail.to` or your Gmail address

### 4. Restart the Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Testing

### Test Email Sending
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/email/send" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "contacts": [
      {
        "email": "your-test-email@gmail.com",
        "firstName": "Test",
        "lastName": "User"
      }
    ],
    "subject": "Test Email from Red Cross",
    "body": "Hello {{firstName}}, this is a test email from the Red Cross system!",
    "eventName": "Test Event"
  }'
```

### Check Configuration
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/email/send"
```

## How It Works

1. **CSV Upload** â†’ User uploads CSV with contacts
2. **Email Processing** â†’ System processes contacts and personalizes emails
3. **SMTP Sending** â†’ Emails are sent via Gmail SMTP to actual recipients
4. **Real Delivery** â†’ Recipients receive emails in their inbox
5. **Reply Tracking** â†’ Recipients can reply to the emails

## Email Template

The system sends this personalized email:

```
Subject: Join Us for a Life-Saving Blood Drive!

- Double-check the App Password (16 characters, no spaces)
- Try generating a new App Password

### Emails not received

## Alternative Email Providers

You can also use other SMTP providers by updating the transporter configuration in `/lib/email-sender.ts`:

- **SendGrid**: `service: 'sendgrid'`

2. **Update the environment variables**
3. **Restart the server**
4. **Test with a CSV upload**
5. **Check your inbox for the emails!**

The system will now send real emails to all contacts in your CSV files! ðŸŽ‰
